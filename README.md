# Neural-Network-Wine-Quality-Prediction

Developed a Python-based neural network for wine quality prediction, optimizing over hyperparameters such as the number of layers, hidden layer sizes, activation functions, batch sizes, optimizers, and metrics.

Efficiently trained and evaluated 46500 possible model configurations to demonstrate the impact of adjustable hyperparameters on prediction accuracy.

Identified key features and feature families contributing to high target quality scores using a comprehensive 0-10 mesh grid evaluation approach.
